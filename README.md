# Simple Calculator

I created this project for... well, dumb purposes.  
Itâ€™s just a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  
Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done (sometimes).  

## Features:
- Addition (because adding is important)
- Subtraction (for when you need to undo all that adding)
- Multiplication (for when adding is just too slow)
- Division (unless you try dividing by zero, then it's just awkward)

## Why does this exist?
Honestly, I was probably bored or trying to procrastinate. Either way, here it is for your amusement.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the `simple_calculator.py` file.
3. Watch the magic happen... kind of.

## Disclaimer
This project is for dumb purposes only. Please don't expect it to solve world hunger or calculate the meaning of life.
